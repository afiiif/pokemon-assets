Because of this quality, this Pokémon is said to be one that puts the Trainer’s abilities to the test.","Its cry leaves a lasting headache if heard for too long. It moves so quickly that it is almost invisible.","Ninjask moves around at such a high speed that it cannot be seen, even while its crying can be clearly heard.
